# BurnerPool
A library for [CCash](https://github.com/EntireTwix/CCash) connected services that manages pools of burner accounts. This is for connected services that need to receive many transactions without worrying about exceeding the log limit. It requires the [CCash Api](https://github.com/SpaceCat-Chan/CatsCCashLuaApi) by SpaceCat-Chan. This is for CCash `v2.6.1`.

For example, lets say many players are betting on the results of a gladiatorial match in-game. After the match is over we need a way to reward the betters who were correct with their proportional winnings, and to keep track of who bet what outcome. This can be implemented quite trivially with this library, simply a `BurnerPool` objects for each outcome (in this case 2), when somebody wants to bet they will contact the CC computer and a wallet adress will be given back for them to send their bet to. When the match concludes we can simply check with `get_logs()` the whole list of those who betted on Player A and the list for Player B regardless of wether the number of betters exceeds the log limit.
